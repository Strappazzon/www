(hereinafter, "I", "Me" or "My"). This Privacy Statement does not cover third-party mirrors or archived versions of This Website.

## Data Collection

This Website is hosted on a [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) server in [Falkenstein, Germany](https://www.hetzner.com/unternehmen/rechenzentrum/).

I collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as:

- Date and Time of the request
- User-Agent (Browser type, Browser version, Operating System)
- Visited URL
- Referrer (Where you came from)

I also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

I use this data to:

- Diagnose and debug technical errors
- Defend My website from abuse and technical attacks
- Compile statistics on page popularity
- Compile statistics on the type of browser and device used

I generally store the above information for a month.  
In special circumstances, such as during an ongoing technical attack or a subsequent investigation, I may retain log data longer for analysis.

I do not track you using cookies, collect your fingerprints, or use any tracking scripts.

## CDN

Fonts are served by Bunny CDN. Bunny.net will not store any personal data or logs.
