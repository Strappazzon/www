The best way to get in touch with me is via email at {% include email.html %}.

> [!WARNING] What I MAY NOT respond to
> I'll try my best to respond to technical questions but I would prefer you try a search engine first.
>
> If your message is vague or I don't understand what its purpose is you may not hear back from me.
>
> Do not bump emails. By doing so, you are lessening the chance that I will reply.
