## Email

The best way to get in touch with me is via email at: {% include email.html %}.

### Email Policy

What I **MAY NOT** respond to:

- I'll try my best to respond to technical questions but I would prefer you try a search engine first.
- If your message is vague or I don't understand what its purpose is you may not hear back from me.
- Do not bump emails. By doing so, you are lessening the chance that I will reply.

What I **WILL NOT** respond to:

- [No Hello](/fwlink/nohello).
- [Don't ask to ask, just ask](/fwlink/dontasktoask).
