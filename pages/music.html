<p>
	The following lists are based on my listening history every year since 2021.
	The artists of each year are sorted from most to least listened.
</p>

<p>
	The lists are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate prior to 2022, as some artists may be missing
	or the listening order might be wrong.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Top artist of every year is featured with a picture.</li>
	<li>New artists of every year are highlighted in <span class="text__color-green">green</span>.</li>
	<li>Artists coming back are highlighted in <span class="text__color-yellow">yellow</span>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="row">
	{% for y in site.data.music %}
		{% include cards/samaritan-artists.html
			year    = y.year
			artists = y.artists
		%}
	{% endfor %}
</div>
